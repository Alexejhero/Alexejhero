## ü§ù Notable Collaborations

### [vedal987](https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987) - Modding & Unity Development (2023-Present)
I started working with vedal in early 2023 as an open-source contributor to the [Among Us mod for Neuro-sama](https://github.com/vedalai/neuro-amongus), becoming the maintainer of the project. Afterwards, I created an (also open-source!) [mod for Subnautica](https://github.com/alexejhero/neurosama-subnautica-mod) for his playthroughs, themed around him and Neuro. I also worked on an integration mod for Neuro for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire which has yet to see the light of day, and [a mod for integrating Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes with PiShock](https://github.com/Alexejhero/KTANE-PiShock-Mod/) which was used during his subathon. Apart from modding, I also created a handful of Unity packages for him, for example one of them adding support for rendering Twitch and 7TV emotes in TextMesh Pro text objects.

### [MoreSidemen](https://www.youtube.com/@MoreSidemen) - Among Us Modding (2022)
I worked with the Sidemen for one or two of their videos, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEK25KcWRjs) which got 6 million views on YouTube.

### [GameToons Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/@GameToonsGaming) - Among Us Modding (2021-2022)
I worked with GameToons for a couple of videos they did, I can't remember which ones exactly but one that I do remember is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC9u2eB5FK4), which got 5 million views on YouTube. 

### [5up](https://www.twitch.tv/5up) - Among Us Modding (2021-2022)
I worked with 5up for almost 2 years, as a project manager and lead developer of the [Submerged](https://github.com/SubmergedAmongUs/Submerged) mod for Among Us. Submerged was the first (and to this day, the only) widely-known mod for Among Us which adds a new entire map into the game. [The trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAX_mDOX4Pc) got around 6 million views on YouTube.

### [Bakbak](https://www.youtube.com/@BakbakIsMe) - Among Us Modding (2020-2021)
I worked with Bakbak for a few months, creating mods for his Among Us videos on YouTube. My first Among Us mod ever was one that I created for him, which he showcased in [his video on November 17th 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWWbBqGVOY0). Most of these videos reached around 1 million views, with [some of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHcsSUHTBqs) reaching almost 2 million.
